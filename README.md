Convert MP3 to WAV

In Python, you may directly convert MP3 to WAV. We'll use Python 3 to accomplish the conversion on this github repository, but any file will work.

To begin, download and install **ffmpeg**. **ffmpeg** is a free audio, video, and multimedia processing application. The program provides a console interface, although it isn't necessary to use it other than to install it.


Convert multiple MP3 audio files in a folder to WAV format (with mono type) using python code.

before start need to install 2 packages

1) **pip install pydub**   #Manipulate audio with an simple and easy high level interface.

2) **pip install audiosegment**  #Wrapper for pydub.AudioSegment for additional high level methods.
